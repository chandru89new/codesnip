## Principles of design.

### Subtract rather than add.

If it can be done without any interface and/or interaction, do it first.

### Clarity over everything else.

Always ask, "does this screen communicate what we want it to communicate 'clearly'"? Words, visuals, positioning, context... everything helps (or distorts) clarity.

### One screen, one purpose.

Every screen that the user comes to lets them do one thing very clearly. What is it? Find that out and design the screen for just this.

### Linearity over branching.

All of us prefer a linear path. Non-linear, branching paths confuse us.

### Lowest number of user-interactions.

Even at the cost of losing choice or options. Even if it means we make assumptions based on guts and data.

### Innovate subtly or go all-in.

Don't be a cat on the wall. Subtle changes often go unnoticed or are very intuitive. Total changes are instantly visible (and users pay more attention). The middle-ground is muddled in confusion.

### Pay attention to the tiniest details.

Both God and the Devil reside there.

### Be concise. Everywhere. In everything.

With words = don't be verbose. 
With design elements = don't over-design.
With motion/animation = don't over-do. In fact, don't use motion design if you don't have a set of motion principles.
