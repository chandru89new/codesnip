# to change the dns in ubuntu 14.04
# i had problems with dns (github and archive.org weren't accessible)
# used a global dns change from terminal, through resolvconf

# i did a couple of things so i dont know which did the trick.

# first add nameservers in the head of resolv.conf.d
$ sudo nano /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head

# add this in the file and save
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

# next, config resolv.conf itself
$ sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

# add the same nameservers above the existing nameserver line
# comment out the existing nameserver like so:
# # nameserver 127.0.1.1
# save the file and exit 

# finally, update resolvconf

$ sudo resolvconf -u
